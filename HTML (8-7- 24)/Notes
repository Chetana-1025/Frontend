HTML is not a programming language it is a markup language 

HTML is Hyper Text Markup language

Hypter text : A special type of that document in which u can add hyperlink of another document 

. Introduction to HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It describes the structure of a web page using a series of elements.


Basic Structure of an HTML Document
Every HTML document has a basic structure, which includes the following elements:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>


<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
<html>: The root element of the HTML document.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the document (e.g., title, character set).
<title>: Sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab.
<body>: Contains the content of the document that is displayed to the user.


Tags : A simple mechanism way where u can tell what is the part of document actually mean 

<TagName> => Opening tag 

</TagName> => Closing tag 

Some tags are used as self closing tag  <TagName/>

In the self closing opening and closing will be managed by the same tag itself 


Headings: Defined with <h1> to <h6> tags, where <h1> is the highest level and <h6> is the lowest.

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>



Paragraphs: Defined with the <p> tag.

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>


Lists: Ordered lists (<ol>) and unordered lists (<ul>) with list items (<li>).

<ul>
  <li>First item in an unordered list</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>First item in an ordered list</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
</ol>


Lists in HTML are used to group a set of related items. There are three main types of lists:

Unordered Lists (<ul>): These lists display items with bullet points.
Ordered Lists (<ol>): These lists display items with numbers or letters.
Description Lists (<dl>): These lists display a list of terms and their descriptions.
1. Unordered Lists
Unordered lists are used to group a collection of items that do not have a specific order. Each item in the list is defined with the <li> (list item) tag.

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>


This code will render as:

Item 1
Item 2
Item 3


Customizing Bullet Points:

You can change the type of bullet points using the list-style-type CSS property. Common values include disc, circle, and square.

<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li>Circle Item 1</li>
  <li>Circle Item 2</li>
</ul>
This code will render as:

○ Circle Item 1
○ Circle Item 2

Ordered Lists
Ordered lists are used to group a collection of items that have a specific order. Each item in the list is defined with the <li> (list item) tag, and the list itself is defined with the <ol> tag.

Basic Ordered List Example:
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
This code will render as:

First item
Second item
Third item

You can change the numbering style using the type attribute in the <ol> tag. Common values include 1, A, a, I, and i.

<ol type="A">
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>

This code will render as:

A. First item
B. Second item
C. Third item

Description Lists
Description lists are used to define terms and their descriptions. These lists use the <dl> tag, with each term enclosed in a <dt> tag and each description enclosed in a <dd> tag.

<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>A markup language for creating web pages.</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>A style sheet language for designing web pages.</dd>
  <dt>JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>A programming language for web development.</dd>
</dl>

Example of Nested Lists:

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2
    <ul>
      <li>Subitem 2.1</li>
      <li>Subitem 2.2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>


Lists can be styled using CSS to create more visually appealing and functional designs.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    ul.styled-list {
      list-style-type: square;
      margin: 20px;
      padding: 10px;
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
    }

    ul.styled-list li {
      color: #333;
      font-size: 18px;
      margin-bottom: 5px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li>Styled Item 1</li>
    <li>Styled Item 2</li>
    <li>Styled Item 3</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>

Emmet is a powerful toolkit for web developers that can greatly speed up the coding process. It is particularly useful in HTML, allowing you to write shorthand code snippets that expand into full-fledged HTML structures. Here’s a guide to using Emmet in HTML:

Basic Emmet Syntax
Emmet abbreviations are like shortcuts that expand into full HTML elements. Here are some of the most commonly used Emmet features:

Basic HTML Tags

Element Creation:
div expands to <div></div>
p expands to <p></p>
Adding Classes and IDs


Class:
div.classname expands to <div class="classname"></div>
p.class1.class2 expands to <p class="class1 class2"></p>

ID:
div#idname expands to <div id="idname"></div>
p#para1 expands to <p id="para1"></p>
Nesting Elements
Child Elements:

div>p expands to <div><p></p></div>
ul>li expands to <ul><li></li></ul>
Sibling Elements:

div+p expands to <div></div><p></p>
h1+h2+h3 expands to <h1></h1><h2></h2><h3></h3>

Multiplication and Numbering

Multiplication:
ul>li*3 expands to <ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul>

Numbering:
ul>li.item$*3 expands to <ul><li class="item1"></li><li class="item2"></li><li class="item3"></li></ul>

Text and Attributes
Adding Text:

a{Click here} expands to <a>Click here</a>
p{Hello World} expands to <p>Hello World</p>
Adding Attributes:

input[type="text"] expands to <input type="text">
a[href="https://example.com"]{Visit} expands to <a href="https://example.com">Visit</a>




Basic Image Insertion
To add images to an HTML document, you use the <img> tag. This tag is self-closing and requires at least two attributes: src and alt.

src (source): Specifies the path to the image file.
alt (alternative text): Provides alternative text for the image if it cannot be displayed.

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

Image Attributes
The <img> tag can include additional attributes to control the appearance and behavior of the image.

Width and Height: Set the size of the image.
Title: Adds a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the image.

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="300" height="200" title="Image Tooltip">

Image Formats
Common image formats used on the web include:

JPEG: Good for photographs and images with many colors.
PNG: Supports transparency and is good for images with fewer colors.
GIF: Supports simple animations.
SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics, used for vector images.
WebP: Modern format providing superior compression for web images.

<img src="image.webp" alt="Description of the image">

Advanced Image Techniques

Lazy Loading: Defer loading of images until they are about to enter the viewport.

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" loading="lazy">


Inline and Block Elements in HTML: In-Depth Explanation
HTML elements are broadly categorized into two types: inline elements and block-level elements. Understanding the difference between these two types is crucial for controlling the layout and behavior of elements on a web page.

Block-Level Elements
Block-level elements take up the full width available, stacking on top of each other, and start on a new line in the document. Common block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, and <li>.

Characteristics of Block-Level Elements:

Occupy Full Width: By default, block-level elements extend the entire width of their parent container.
Starts on a New Line: Each block-level element begins on a new line, creating a line break before and after the element.
Contain Other Elements: Block-level elements can contain other block-level elements and inline elements.

<div>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>This is another paragraph in a new div.</p>
</div>


Inline Elements
Inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not force a new line in the document flow. Common inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, and <img>.

Characteristics of Inline Elements:

Occupy Only Necessary Width: Inline elements take up only as much width as their content requires.
Do Not Start on a New Line: They do not create a new line before or after the element.
Cannot Contain Block-Level Elements: Inline elements typically only contain other inline elements or text content.


<p>This is a paragraph with an <a href="#">inline link</a> and some <strong>bold text</strong>.</p>


The <div> and <span> Elements
The <div> and <span> elements are generic containers used to group and style content. Their default display properties are block-level and inline, respectively.

The <div> Element
Display: Block-level element.
Usage: Used to group block-level elements or to apply CSS styles to a section of content.

Example:

<div class="container">
  <h2>Section Heading</h2>
  <p>Some text inside a div.</p>
  <p>Another paragraph inside the same div.</p>
</div>

CSS for <div>:
.container {
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}


The <span> Element
Display: Inline element.
Usage: Used to group inline elements or to apply CSS styles to a part of the text without disrupting the flow of the document.
Example:

<p>This is a <span class="highlight">highlighted text</span> within a paragraph.</p>


.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
  font-weight: bold;
}

HTML Video and Audio: From Basic to Advanced
1. Basic Video Embedding
To embed a video in HTML, you use the <video> tag. This tag requires a src attribute for the video file, and it supports various attributes to control playback.
